This activity felt much more difficult for me compared to the first one. I ended up having to use a lot of online resources to help me out, and I’m not very confident in a lot of the code I submitted. I think that my main issue has to do with correct formatting since python is so specific in the way that code is written and one miniscule punctuation mistake can screw everything over and result in an error, and oftentimes, it’s those tiny errors that are difficult to catch. For that reason, I felt a little confused with the first question, but I assumed that the lack of quotes was the issue since the following list had quotes around every item on the list. The eighth question was especially confusing for me since I’ve been having difficulty with identifying errors in code. I found that defining the variables at the beginning got the cell to run, but I still feel like I’m missing something in that problem since the output was sort of confusing in a conceptual sense. The “Defining Functions” section of the activity on the other hand felt a little bit easier for me, and I didn’t have as much trouble with writing the code to create a calculator or to convert temperature from fahrenheit to celsius. Ultimately, my takeaway after attempting this activity is that I need to put much more focus onto functions that deal with lists and for loops because I feel like I could’ve done a lot better on those problems.
